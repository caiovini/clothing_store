Clothing store
Overview:
A fictitious clothing store company in New Zealand wants to implement a new application to be able to integrate and show customers different existing models of products available at its different branches around Auckland.
The intention is basically show what can be purchased and indicate where is the closest branch available. 
The customers can also reserve the model they want to buy and pick it up at a certain time of the day at the closest branch. The use of technology will certainly decrease the operational costs of the company and the products will be offered for a cheaper price.
 
Functional requirements:

1 -) Maintain clothing prices information:

1.1	The mobile application will store information about the clothes and which branch it will be available (model, ID number, price which branch is available and number in stock). 

1.2 Add login functionality for general manager and branch manager.

1.3 The information about the clothes will be updated on a daily basis considering the number of sales during the day and considering the new products added to the stock. This information will be updated by the branch manager or general manager and changes will be limited to 24 hours for each product.

1.4 The branch manager and general manager will have access to modify all information about the products.

1.5	There should be discount vouchers options to be typed by the customers.

2 -) Place order: 

2.1 Customer will access the application to look for clothes of interest. There will be the option to filter by type (skirts, jeans, jackets, t-shirts, etc.)

2.2 When the customer finds the product he wants to buy, an order is made and he will access the screen to type personal information (credit/debit number, name, email, address, etc.).

2.3 Customers can also check if the closest branch has the available item he is willing to purchase.

2.4 If the products are not available, the customer can reserve the item and pick it up. The customer must do the reservation before 13:00 if they want to pick them up in the same day. The products will be put on hold for 7 days, until it expires.


3 -) Social media capabilities:

Give the customers the possibility of sharing products on their social media, this will give more visibility to store and customers who like the products being exposed can make a word of mouth ad through their social media.
